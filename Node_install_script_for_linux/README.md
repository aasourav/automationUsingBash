### Node install script for Linux
Hello, I created this script to make installing Node in Linux distribution easier. You know that `sudo apt install nodejs` installed nodev14. 
This will not work. So we have to install Node on our machine manually. That is painful. I created a script to make your life hassle-free.
This script will automate your manual Node installation process.

**How to Install**
- Download the **nodeV18Install.sh**
- Right-click on the file.
    - go to **Properties**
    - then **Permissions**
    - then check the **Execute** option

- Now double-click on the file
- Choose **Run in Terminal**

- When running the command, you will be asked for a password for sudo permission. Write the password, then hit enter
- Done.
